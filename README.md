# Teapot Sample

This project demonstrates Windows and Android sharing C++ code.
(Work in progress, please report bugs and suggestions)

## Windows Setup

In order to build run this sample on Windows you will need libraries 'freeglut' and 'glew'.

One way to get these is to use vcpkg:

```
./vcpkg install freeglut:x64-windows
./vcpkg install glew:x64-windows
./vcpkg install freeglut:x86-windows
./vcpkg install glew:x86-windows
```
